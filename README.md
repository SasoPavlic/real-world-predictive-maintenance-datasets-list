# Real-World Predictive Maintenance Datasets List

## Overview

This repository curates a growing list of **publicly available,
real‑world predictive maintenance (PdM) datasets**. The goal is to
provide a single place where researchers and practitioners can quickly
identify datasets for anomaly detection, remaining‑useful‑life (RUL)
estimation and context‑aware maintenance modelling. Each dataset entry
consolidates information on sensor modalities, sampling cadence, size,
labelling strategy and licence to help you assess whether it suits your
needs. By focusing on datasets with contextual labels (maintenance
events, fault windows or operating regimes) we hope to encourage the
development of methods -- such as recurrent VAEs -- that adapt to
evolving "normal" behaviour rather than assuming a static distribution.

## Dataset summary

The table below summarises the key characteristics of each dataset. The
**feature type** column gives a high‑level description of the sensor
modalities; **# instances** refers to the number of time steps or
segments provided (when available); **# features** is the approximate
number of variables per time stamp; **Approx. size (GB)** gives an
order‑of‑magnitude estimate when file sizes or record counts are known;
the **Data type** indicates whether the data are real or synthetic; and
the **Link** points to the official data source.

Below you will find detailed descriptions of each dataset, including
information on labelling, file formats, availability of pre‑defined
training/testing splits and suitability for recurrent VAE methods. Where
possible we provide citations to original papers or dataset
descriptions.

### CWRU Bearing Data Center

**Domain & sensors:** The Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset
contains high‑frequency vibration signals acquired on a laboratory test
rig equipped with a 2 hp induction motor and rolling bearings.
Single‑point faults of various sizes were introduced on the inner race,
outer race and ball using electro‑discharge machining, while a baseline
set of healthy bearings was also
recorded[\[1\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.14625v1#:~:text=The%20CWRU%20bearing%20fault%20dataset,world%20scenarios).
Acceleration signals were measured at the drive end, fan end and bearing
base at 12--48 kHz and the motor speed (rpm) was logged.

**Context labels:** Each file corresponds to a specific bearing
condition (healthy or a particular fault type and size). There are no
explicit maintenance events or run‑to‑failure sequences; users must
treat the fault labels as
anomalies[\[1\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.14625v1#:~:text=The%20CWRU%20bearing%20fault%20dataset,world%20scenarios).

**Short description & characteristics:**

-   **Run‑to‑failure:** No -- samples are short bursts with seeded
    faults.
-   **Ease of use:** Moderate; data are provided in MATLAB (.mat) files
    at high sampling rates, requiring resampling or feature extraction.
-   **File format:** MATLAB (.mat).
-   **Has description:** Yes -- the dataset page and many papers
    describe sampling rates and experimental
    setup[\[1\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.14625v1#:~:text=The%20CWRU%20bearing%20fault%20dataset,world%20scenarios).
-   **Number of datasets:** Four sets (normal baseline and three fault
    types) at multiple motor loads.
-   **Rows:** Varies -- each file contains 4--10 s of vibration and
    speed data.
-   **Columns:** 2--3 sensors (drive‑end, fan‑end, base) plus rpm.
-   **Labelled events:** No -- only fault vs normal classification.
-   **Labelled anomalies:** Yes -- each file is labelled by fault type
    and size.
-   **Labelled components:** Yes -- faults are labelled by location
    (inner race, outer race, ball). The motor itself is not anonymised.
-   **Separate train/test:** No -- users typically split data manually;
    however, caution is needed to avoid leakage because the same bearing
    appears under different
    loads[\[2\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.14625v1#:~:text=The%20CWRU%20bearing%20fault%20dataset,world%20scenarios).
-   **Data type:** Real.
-   **Literature:** Numerous publications; see e.g. the dataset
    description[\[2\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.14625v1#:~:text=The%20CWRU%20bearing%20fault%20dataset,world%20scenarios).
-   **GitHub examples:** Many open‑source examples of bearing fault
    diagnosis using this dataset.
-   **Suitability for RNN‑VAE:** Moderate -- short, high‑frequency
    segments are well suited for classification but offer limited
    temporal context.
-   **License:** Not explicitly stated (research use only).
-   **Version:** N/A.
-   **Dataset link:** <https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter>.

### Paderborn Bearing (KAt DataCenter)

**Domain & sensors:** This dataset from the Paderborn University
KAt DataCenter contains vibration and current measurements of rolling
bearings under various conditions. It includes healthy bearings,
artificially damaged bearings (single point faults) and bearings with
accelerated life‑induced failures. Sensors measure motor current,
vibration, rotational speed and torque; some versions include additional
load
parameters[\[3\]](https://mb.uni-paderborn.de/kat/forschung/kat-datacenter/bearing-datacenter/data-sets-and-download#:~:text=The%20main%20characteristic%20of%20the,data%20set%20are).

**Context labels:** Each measurement is associated with a specific
bearing state (e.g. healthy, inner race fault, outer race fault, ball
fault). There are no run‑to‑failure sequences or maintenance events; the
labels are categorical damage classes.

**Short description & characteristics:**

-   **Run‑to‑failure:** No -- data are collected as 4‑s segments for
    each bearing state.
-   **Ease of use:** Moderate; multiple MATLAB (.mat) files with fact
    sheets describing the states and measurement conditions.
-   **File format:** MATLAB (.mat).
-   **Has description:** Yes -- the KAt DataCenter provides detailed
    descriptions of states, sensors and measurement
    numbers[\[3\]](https://mb.uni-paderborn.de/kat/forschung/kat-datacenter/bearing-datacenter/data-sets-and-download#:~:text=The%20main%20characteristic%20of%20the,data%20set%20are).
-   **Number of datasets:** 32 bearing states comprising 6 healthy
    bearings and 26 faulty bearings (12 artificial and 14 natural
    faults).
-   **Rows:** Varies -- each measurement is a 4‑s high‑rate recording.
-   **Columns:** Motor current, vibration, speed, torque and torque
    variation signals.
-   **Labelled events:** No -- only damage class labels.
-   **Labelled anomalies:** Yes -- normal vs fault labels.
-   **Labelled components:** Yes -- bearing states are identifiable and
    not anonymised.
-   **Separate train/test:** No -- the user must create splits.
-   **Data type:** Real.
-   **Literature:** Data described in KAt DataCenter documentation and
    numerous Paderborn publications.
-   **GitHub examples:** Multiple open‑source fault diagnosis examples
    exist.
-   **Suitability for RNN‑VAE:** Moderate -- multiple sensors provide a
    multivariate signal, but segments are short and lack context.
-   **License:** Unknown (available for academic use).
-   **Version:** N/A.
-   **Dataset link:**

### Bearing Ring Grinder (SKF)

**Domain & sensors:** This dataset from SKF documents a real industrial
bearing‑ring grinding process. During seven test runs and seven dressing
cycles on a production grinding machine, multiple sensor channels were
recorded, including vibration, acoustic emission, grinding force and
temperature[\[4\]](https://researchdata.se/en/catalogue/dataset/2022-136-1).
Additional meta‑data describe the set‑up (wheel dressing, ring ID) and
quality parameters of the finished rings.

**Context labels:** Each ring is labelled with its failure mode or
quality class; process variables (e.g. dressing cycles) act as
contextual events. This allows the user to study how new set‑ups change
the normal operating regime.

**Short description & characteristics:**

-   **Run‑to‑failure:** No -- data represent quality monitoring rather
    than run‑to‑failure experiments.
-   **Ease of use:** Complex -- sensor data are stored in National
    Instruments TDMS files and accompanied by CSV and PDF documentation.
    Dedicated libraries (e.g. `nptdms`) are required to extract
    time‑series
    signals[\[4\]](https://researchdata.se/en/catalogue/dataset/2022-136-1).
-   **File format:** TDMS, CSV and
    PDF[\[4\]](https://researchdata.se/en/catalogue/dataset/2022-136-1).
-   **Has description:** Yes -- `readme_data_description.pdf` and
    associated documentation explain sensors, test runs and quality
    parameters[\[4\]](https://researchdata.se/en/catalogue/dataset/2022-136-1).
-   **Number of datasets:** Approximately seven test runs × seven
    dressing cycles × 15 rings (\~735 rings).
-   **Rows:** Not specified -- continuous raw time‑series are provided.
-   **Columns:** Multiple analogue (vibration, acoustic emission, force,
    temperature) and digital channels.
-   **Labelled events:** Yes -- meta‑data include quality parameters and
    process data (setup/dress cycles).
-   **Labelled anomalies:** Yes -- rings are classified by failure mode
    or quality class.
-   **Labelled components:** Yes -- sensor channels and ring identifiers
    are not anonymised.
-   **Separate train/test:** No -- users must define their own splits.
-   **Data type:** Real.
-   **Literature:** See Ahmer et al., 2022 (International Journal of
    Advanced Manufacturing Technology) and associated SKF publications.
-   **GitHub examples:** Only a few examples exist due to the TDMS
    format.
-   **Suitability for RNN‑VAE:** High -- long, multi‑sensor sequences
    with varying operating regimes and quality labels provide a rich
    testbed for continual adaptation.
-   **License:**
    CC BY 4.0[\[5\]](https://researchdata.se/en/catalogue/dataset/2022-136-1#:~:text=).

### Hydropower Turbine Friction Monitoring

**Domain & sensors:** This dataset collects hydraulic monitoring data
from two Kaplan turbines at a hydropower plant. Each CSV file logs
pressure and temperature statistics (mean, minimum and median) at
1‑minute intervals and includes a binary flag indicating whether
glycerol (lubricant) is
present[\[6\]](https://researchdata.se/en/catalogue/dataset/2025-35#:~:text=The%20datasets%20contain%20pressure%20and,than%201%20sample%20per%20minute).

**Context labels:** The glycerol flag acts as a context label,
distinguishing periods when lubrication is present or absent. There are
no explicit fault labels; rather, the data are intended for detecting
changes in friction behaviour across these regimes.

**Short description & characteristics:**

-   **Run‑to‑failure:** No.
-   **Ease of use:** Easy -- two CSV files with self‑explaining column
    names and a
    README[\[6\]](https://researchdata.se/en/catalogue/dataset/2025-35#:~:text=The%20datasets%20contain%20pressure%20and,than%201%20sample%20per%20minute).
-   **File format:** CSV.
-   **Has description:** Yes -- the dataset page explains all variables
    and the lubrication
    context[\[6\]](https://researchdata.se/en/catalogue/dataset/2025-35#:~:text=The%20datasets%20contain%20pressure%20and,than%201%20sample%20per%20minute).
-   **Number of datasets:** Two (Turbine 1 and Turbine 2).
-   **Rows:** Not specified -- 1‑minute sampling over the monitoring
    period (several months).
-   **Columns:** Pressure and temperature variables (mean, min, median)
    and the glycerol flag.
-   **Labelled events:** Yes -- lubrication flag provides a context
    event.
-   **Labelled anomalies:** No -- there are no failure labels.
-   **Labelled components:** Yes -- variables correspond to specific
    hydraulic components.
-   **Separate train/test:** No.
-   **Data type:** Real.
-   **Literature:** Sandström et al., 2025.
-   **GitHub examples:** Limited.
-   **Suitability for RNN‑VAE:** Moderate -- low‑frequency time series
    are useful for studying gradual drift and changing regimes.
-   **License:**
    CC BY 4.0[\[7\]](https://researchdata.se/en/catalogue/dataset/2025-35#:~:text=License%3A).

### IMAD‑DS (Industrial Multi‑Sensor Anomaly Detection)

**Domain & sensors:** IMAD‑DS provides multi‑rate sensor recordings from
two scaled test benches: a robotic arm and a brushless DC motor. Each
segment contains an analogue audio signal, a three‑axis accelerometer
and a three‑axis gyroscope. Data are sampled at different rates and
stored as Parquet files accompanied by metadata
CSVs[\[8\]](https://zenodo.org/records/12665499#:~:text=Description).

**Context labels:** Metadata indicate the operating condition (normal vs
anomalous), fault mechanism (e.g. removing bolts, adding magnets or
tightening belts) and environmental noise conditions. This allows
domain‑shift evaluation across operating speeds and noise
levels[\[9\]](https://zenodo.org/records/12665499#:~:text=Data%20is%20collected%20using%20the,the%20dataset%20are%20the%20following).

**Short description & characteristics:**

-   **Run‑to‑failure:** No -- anomalies are injected artificially.
-   **Ease of use:** Moderate -- data are packaged in `.7z` archives;
    the sensor streams are stored in Parquet with separate metadata
    CSVs[\[10\]](https://zenodo.org/records/12665499#:~:text=Data%20Format%3A%20Files%20are%20already,parquet%27%20file).
-   **File format:** Parquet (sensor data) and CSV (metadata).
-   **Has description:** Yes -- the Zenodo page and the DCASE 2024 paper
    describe machines, sensors and anomaly
    types[\[8\]](https://zenodo.org/records/12665499#:~:text=Description).
-   **Number of datasets:** Two machines with separate normal and
    anomalous segments.
-   **Rows:** Not specified -- each segment has a variable length.

### MetroPT‑3 (UCI)

**Domain & sensors:** MetroPT‑3 is a multivariate time series collected
from a sewerage‑treatment‑plant compressor system. It comprises seven
analogue sensors (e.g. pressures, temperatures, currents) and eight
digital signals capturing valve states and
alarms[\[12\]](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/791/metropt%203%20dataset).

**Context labels:** Maintenance reports were used to derive ground‑truth
failure windows. The dataset includes timestamps for the start and end
of three catastrophic failures (two air leaks and one oil leak), so you
can analyse how measurements drift before and after
maintenance[\[13\]](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/791/metropt%203%20dataset#:~:text=Data%20Set%20Information%3A%20The%20dataset,You%20can).

turbine supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) datasets used
for anomaly detection research. It contains SCADA measurements from 36
turbines in three farms, spanning 89 years of operating data and
released as 95 sub‑datasets. Each dataset comprises one year of training
data and 4--98 days of prediction data with 10‑minute sampling. The
number of features differs by farm: 86 for farm A, 257 for farm B and
957 for
farm C[\[21\]](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/9/12/138#:~:text=The%20data%20consist%20of%2095,points%20of%20the%20time%20series)[\[22\]](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/9/12/138#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20features%20in,indicating%20the%20turbine%20status%20at).

**Context labels:** Each dataset is labelled as either normal or
containing an anomaly event. Within each dataset, a `status_id`
identifies turbine operating modes (normal, service mode, fault, etc.),
and anomaly windows are defined based on logbooks and service
reports[\[23\]](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/9/12/138#:~:text=The%20data%20are%20labeled%20on,the%20data%2C%20and%20expert%20knowledge).
